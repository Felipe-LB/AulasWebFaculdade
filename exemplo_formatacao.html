    <h1>What A Wonderful World</h1>

    <h4>Louis Armstrong</h4>

    <div>
        <p>I see trees of green,</p> 
        <p>Red roses too</p>
        <p>I see them bloom</p>
        <p>For me and you</p>
        <p>And I think to myself,</p>
        <p>What a wonderful world</p>
    </div>


    <div>
        <p></p>I see skies of blue
        <p></p>And clouds of white,
        <p></p>The bright blessed day,
        <p></p>The dark sacred night
        <p></p>And I think to myself,
        <p></p>What a wonderful world
    </div>


    <div>
        <p></p>The colors of the rainbow
        <p></p>So pretty in the sky
        <p></p>Are also on the faces
        <p></p>Of people going by
        <p></p>I see friends shaking hands,
        <p></p>Saying: "How do you do?"
        <p></p>They're really saying
        <p></p>"I love you"
    </div>


    <div>
        <p></p>I hear babies crying,
        <p></p>I watch them grow
        <p></p>They'll learn much more,
        <p></p>than I'll never know
        <p></p>And I think to myself,
        <p></p>What a wonderful world
    </div>


    <div>
        <p></p>Yes, I think to myself,
        <p></p>What a wonderful world
    </div>
